This post is partly about wanting to shout on the top of a mountain, (ala Ron Burgandy) that my wife Barbara and I welcomed our daughter Aria Marie Pavicevac-Ortiz, on Tuesday August 16th at 2:31PM in the year 2016, to the world!!!

As you can see from the date of this post and from the date of my previous post, I have been busy! Fear not friends, I have been steadliy learning what I can–when I can!

Lately my studies bring me to a course on PluralSight [Building Web Applications with Node.js and Express 4.0 by Jonathan Mills](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/nodejs-express-web-applications). He really goes into the tooling of your project (using [bower](https://bower.io/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for task-running), templating your views, integrating a database and utilizing a service. All the while getting you cozy with Express.js and Node.js. If you remember, from my previous posts I have been adamant about sticking with "Vanilla JS" and staying clear of frameworks and the like. I am happy to report my friends, I think I've finally graduated to one...[<i>Express.js</i>](http://expressjs.com/).

Why the change of heart? After working with Express.js for a bit, I think what I like about it is its core methods remind me of the fundamental interaction of the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol). And—working with Node.js makes me feel I am learning JavaScript all over again but with a emphasis on Asynchronicity*.

Speaking of podcasts, I ran into one of which is apropos of the news I disclosed earlier. Linda Liukas a Finnish computer programmer, was on the [HanselMinutes podcast](http://hanselminutes.com/547/hello-ruby-with-linda-liukas) discussing her children's book [Hello Ruby](http://www.helloruby.com).
To give you some background, in 2014 Linda raised $380,000 on Kickstarter becoming the platform's most highly funded children's book. The story and Linda's exuberance is so inspiring and Scott does a terrific job (as usual) of asking questions which seem to make the guests shine. Since having Aria, I regularly daydream about what she'll be interested in, and what will her passions be? And what kind of future she'll be a part of? Forgive me if I am making this sound epic—but I really think this book is giving us a glimpse of the sensibilites of this future age. I promptly put it on my todo to purchase ;) I love you Aria!!
