    "I just graduated from FullStack Academy; My focus specifically is JavaScript and would make a great addition to a team who seeks a Front-end developer with 1-2 years of experience. To gauge a bit of my sensibility, I am really into Kyle Simpson's book series \"You don't know JS\". I'd go into a blog-post type of description here, as to why I think the series is so great, but maybe that'll get you to contact me!",
